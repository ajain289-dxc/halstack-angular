  <p>
    The CDK has a default theme that will be applied if there is no custom theme
    registered. The ThemeModule, ThemeService and the directive
    <code>theme</code> need to be inserted in your app module and HTML
    component, as in the example below.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, you can customize the components with your own theme and branding.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to apply this theme customization, we need to use the ThemeService
    and ThemeModule classes, as well as the Theme interface, which are all
    provided by the CDK. ThemeService is the service that will be registering
    the theme in your app and ThemeModule is the module that allows this service
    to work.
  </p>
  <p>Please follow the next steps to add your own theme:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Provide ThemeService and import ThemeModule in your app module.</li>
    <li>
      In order to create your theme properties, you should declare the theme
      variables following the same schema as provided in the example below. The
      variables are documented in each component's documentation. Then, override
      the default palette with your own just by chaning the color HEX codes. For
      that, you can use the Theme interface, also provided by the CDK.
    </li>
    <li>
      Inject ThemeService and register your theme in app.component.ts. This will
      be done with the help of the exported
      <code>register(theme: Theme)</code> function.
    </li>
    <li>Include the directive <code>theme</code> in your HTML component.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Check out the example:</p>
