    You are welcome to open an issue there at any time, but before doing it,
    please consider the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Somebody else migh have already created an issue regarding your question
      or feature request. Please use the search functionality and
      <b>avoid the creation of duplicated issues</b>. In case you want to
      provide your input or express your interest in a feature request, please
      do it in the existing issue.
    </li>
    <li>
      These components are built with the intention of helping developers with
      the most common use cases. But at the same time, we want to keep their
      APIs as simple and intuitive as possible. If you notice a missing feature,
      the team is always happy to discuss about it. But please have in mind that
      we might decide to give it a
      <b>lower priority</b> than what you could expect, or <b>even reject</b> it
      for the sake of API simplicity.
    </li>
    <li>
      In case you need a <b>missing feature</b>, or modify a component in any
      way, you can always <b>fork</b> the repository or copy a component to your
      application and take it up on your own. If you think this modification
      would be useful as part of the library, we gratefully accept contributions
      via pull request (see next section)
    </li>
  </ul>
